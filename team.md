excerpt: "CAT Water models team"
---

We are an interdisciplinary and international team of early career researchers (two postdocs, two doctoral researchers). We have a keen interest in researching water combining and contrasting different disciplinary perspectives including human geography (Alba Rossella Alba), governance (Rozemarijn ter Horst) and water resources management (Jonatan Godinez Madrigal) and hydrological modelling (Bich Tran). We are currently engaged in researching the role of models (particularly hydrological models) and modellers in influencing water governance and management in four distinct projects and in different locations and case studies.

## Rossella Alba

{% include figure.html image="https://www.iri-thesys.org/media/Alba_website-image-500x500.jpeg" position="right" width="150" height="150" %}

Postdoctoral researcher,  the Geography Institute and at the Integrative Research Institute on Transformations of Human-Environment Systems (IRI THESys) of Humboldt University of Berlin.

She is the scientific coordinator of the interdisciplinary project “Water security for whom?” financed by the Volkswagen Foundation. As part of the project, she investigates the role of models and modellers in (re)configuring socio-ecological inequalities and water-food-energy relations in the context of multi-purpose dams in Colombia. She has research interests include environmental justice, (urban) political ecology, socio-technical interactions and in the potentials offered by inter- and trans-disciplinary collaboration to foster critical water geographies and just transformations.

## Rozemarijn ter Horst

{% include figure.html image="https://www.paris-iea.fr/images/residents/30584/rh-ter-horst.jpg" position="left" width="150" height="150" %}

Lecturer/PhD researcher, the Water Resources Management group at Wageningen University.

She researches how technologies, including models and innovations are shaped by, and in turn shape, policy processes related to shared waters. Rozemarijn’s research interests encompass sociotechnical imaginaries, specifically how data and technologies play a role in identifying generally accepted options for development, understanding interactions between lay-people and experts as well as between different disciplines. Before herwork with Wageningen University, Rozemarijn has worked at IHE Delft on water diplomacy, and remains affiliated as Guest Researcher Transboundary Water Governance.

## Jonatan Godinez Madrigal

Posdoctoral researcher,  IHE Delft Institute for Water Education. 

His research consists of studying water conflicts in the Global South with special emphasis on the ripples they originate in other fields of knowledge, such as the scientific objects (i.e. water resources models) that are used to resolve the knowledge controversies that drive the conflicts. He has published numerous scientific papers in high-impact journals on a critical perspective of science-policy processes, water conflicts as drivers of societal transformations, and transdisciplinary production of knowledge to transform water conflicts and socio-technical systems.

## Bich Tran

{% include figure.html image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trngbich/trngbich.github.io/gh-pages/trngbich.jpg" position="left" width="150" height="150" %}

PhD researcher, IHE Delft Institute for Water Education. 

 She researches uncertainties in evapotranspiration derived from satellite data and how the implication of these uncertainties in water resources assessment. Before her PhD research, Bich worked as a research assistant at IHE Delft on the Water Accounting Plus (WA+) framework, which uses open-access earth observation data and spatially distributed hydrological models for water resources assessment at the basin level. She has conducted several water accounting studies and found interest in the uncertainties of these data, models, and water resources assessments.
